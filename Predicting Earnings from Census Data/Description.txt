Predicting Earnings from census data
The United States government periodically collects demographic information by conducting a census.

In this problem, we are going to use census information about an individual to predict how much a person earns -- in particular, whether the person earns more than $50,000 per year. This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The file census.csv contains 1994 census data for 31,978 individuals in the United States.

The dataset includes the following 13 variables:

age = the age of the individual in years
workclass = the classification of the individual's working status (does the person work for the federal government, work for the local government, work without pay, and so on)
education = the level of education of the individual (e.g., 5th-6th grade, high school graduate, PhD, so on)
maritalstatus = the marital status of the individual
occupation = the type of work the individual does (e.g., administrative/clerical work, farming/fishing, sales and so on)
relationship = relationship of individual to his/her household
race = the individual's race
sex = the individual's sex
capitalgain = the capital gains of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for more than the original purchase price)
capitalloss = the capital losses of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for less than the original purchase price)
hoursperweek = the number of hours the individual works per week
nativecountry = the native country of the individual
over50k = whether or not the individual earned more than $50,000 in 1994
